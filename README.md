## Usage
1. `git clone https://github.com/artnos/webpack_react_babel_starter.git`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

It should automatically open itself, if you run into an error on npm start.
Try change the port number in your webpack.config.js

You might have to install webpack-dev-server globally to run npm start
`npm i -g webpack-dev-server`
