# React Starter

This is my personal react starter, with packages I frequently use.

## Installation

*Before you install, please remove the packages you won't use in the package.json file.
I have a breakdown of the packages below.

1. `git clone https://github.com/artnos/react_starter.git`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start` / `npm run dev`   or `npm run prod`  
  

### Important Packages 

    redux-devtools-extension
You need to install the chrome dev tools to use

    webpack-dev-server
Must be installed globally.

### Optional Packages

`redux` is the store for large Apps.  
`redux-form` is a great library to handle forms  
`redux-thunk` middleware to handle async calls

`globalize` internationalization and localization  
`moment` is a great library to format time.   
`react-widgets`,`react-widgets-globalize` and `react-widgets-momment`    
are used together with the `<Datepicker/>` and other widget    

`firebase` realtime DB  
 `lodash` js utilities
 
 ### Honrable Mention
 Not included  
 `jump.js` screen jump  
 `acounting.js` math  
 `redux-promise`
 
## Future

I want to update this starter as new version of Reacts gets released and test them with all the packages that are installed to catch errors early in a controlled state. I also want to link to the repo for easier access.
